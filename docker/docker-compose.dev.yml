# Dev mode overlay - mounts scripts for live editing without rebuilds
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
#
# This allows developers working on this tool to:
# - Edit scripts on the host and see changes immediately in the container
# - Test script changes without rebuilding the Docker image
# - Iterate faster during development
#
# To enable: Set DEV_MODE=1 in docker/.env before running the setup wizard
#
# SECURITY WARNING: This mode mounts host scripts directly into the container.
# Only use for local development. Never commit .env with DEV_MODE=1 enabled.
# Scripts from the host run with container privileges.
